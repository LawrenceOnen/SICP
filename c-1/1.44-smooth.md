The idea of smoothing a function is an important concept in signal processing. If f is a function and dx is some small number, then the smoothed version of f is the function whose value at a point x is the average of f(x - dx), f(x), and f(x + dx). Write a procedure smooth that takes as input a procedure that computes f and returns a procedure that computes the smoothed f. It is sometimes valuable to repeatedly smooth a function (that is, smooth the smoothed function, and so on) to obtained the n-fold smoothed function. Show how to generate the n-fold smoothed function of any given function using smooth and repeated from exercise 1.43.

```scheme
(define (compose f g)
    (lambda (x) (f (g x))))

(define (repeated f n)
    (define (loop k result)
        (if (= k 1)
            result
            (loop (- k 1) (compose f result))))
    (lambda (x) ((loop n f) x)))

(define dx 0.000001)

(define (smooth f)
    (lambda (x) (/ (+ (f x) (f (+ x dx)) (f (- x dx))) 3.0)))

(define (repeated-smooth f n)
    ((repeated smooth n) f))

; Use sqrt to test the function

(define (sqrt-iter guess x lastguess)
  (if (good-enough? guess lastguess)
      guess
      (sqrt-iter (improve guess x)
                 x guess)))

(define (improve guess x)
  (average guess (/ x guess)))

(define (average x y)
  (/ (+ x y) 2))

(define (good-enough? guess lastguess)
    (< (/ (abs (-  guess lastguess)) guess) 0.001)
)

(define (sqrt x)
  (sqrt-iter 1.0 x 0))

((repeated-smooth sqrt 5) 9)
```
