The following pattern of numbers is called Pascal's triangle.

```
    1
   1 1
  1 2 1
 1 3 3 1
1 4 6 4 1
```

The numbers at the edge of the triangle are all 1, and each number inside the triangle is the sum of the two numbers above it.35 Write a procedure that computes elements of Pascal's triangle by means of a recursive process.

```
(define (pascal-triangle-el row col)
    (cond ((or (= col 1) (= row col)) 1)
          ((> col row) 0)
          (else (+ (pascal-triangle-el (- row 1) (- col 1)) (pascal-triangle-el (- row 1) col)))))
```

Input an integer as the rows need to be calculated to, output a list containing each row as an list element in the list.

```
(define (pascal-triangle rows)
    (define (next-row current)
        (define (next-row-iter nl curr-pos)
            (if (= (- (length current) 1) curr-pos)
                (append nl '(1))
                (next-row-iter (append nl (list (+ (list-ref current curr-pos)
                                        (list-ref current (+ curr-pos 1)))))
                    (+ curr-pos 1))))
        (next-row-iter '(1) 0))
    (define (all-row current count result)
        (if (< count 1)
            result
            (all-row (next-row current) (- count 1) (append result (list current)))))
    (all-row '(1) rows '()))
```

Iterative version for pascal-triangle-el

```
(define (pascal-triangle-el-iter row col)
    (define (next-row current)
        (define (next-row-iter nl curr-pos)
            (if (= (- (length current) 1) curr-pos)
                (append nl '(1))
                (next-row-iter (append nl (list (+ (list-ref current curr-pos)
                                        (list-ref current (+ curr-pos 1)))))
                    (+ curr-pos 1))))
        (next-row-iter '(1) 0))
    (define (inner-iter current)
        (if (= (length current) row)
            (list-ref current (- col 1))
            (inner-iter (next-row current))))
    (inner-iter '(1)))
```
