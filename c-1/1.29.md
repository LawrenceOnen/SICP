Simpson's Rule is a more accurate method of numerical integration than 
the method illustrated above. Using Simpson's Rule, the integral of 
a function f between a and b is approximated as

```
h(y₀ + 4y₁ + 2y₂ + 4y₃ + 2y₄ + ... + 2yₓ₋₂ + 4yₓ₋₁ + yₓ)/3
```

where h = (b - a)/n, for some even integer n, and yk = f(a + kh). 
(Increasing n increases the accuracy of the approximation.) 
Define a procedure that takes as arguments f, a, b, and n and 
returns the value of the integral, computed using Simpson's Rule. 
Use your procedure to integrate cube between 0 and 1 (with n = 100 and n = 1000), 
and compare the results to those of the integral procedure shown above.

```
(define (sum term a next b)
  (if (> a b)
      0
      (+ (term a)
         (sum term (next a) next b))))

(define (integral f a b dx)
  (define (add-dx x) (+ x dx))
  (* (sum f (+ a (/ dx 2.0)) add-dx b)
     dx))

(define (cube x)
  (* x x x))

(integral cube 0 1 0.01)
```

Simpson's Rule version

```
(define (simpson f a b n)
    (define (odd? x)
        (= (remainder x 2) 1))
    (define (even? x)
        (= (remainder x 2) 0))
    (define (inc x)
        (+ x 1))
    (define (h)
        (/ (- b a) n))
    (define (y k)
        (f (+ a (* k (h)))))
    (define (term k)
        (* (cond ((odd? k) 4)
                 ((or (= k 0) (= k n)) 1)
                 ((even? k) 2))
           (y k)))
    (* (/ (h) 3)
       (sum term 0 inc n)))
```
