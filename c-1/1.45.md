We saw in section 1.3.3 that attempting to compute square roots by naively finding a fixed point of y ⟼ x/y does not converge, and that this can be fixed by average damping. The same method works for finding cube roots as fixed points of the average-damped y ⟼ x/y2. Unfortunately, the process does not work for fourth roots – a single average damp is not enough to make a fixed-point search for y ⟼ x/y3 converge. On the other hand, if we average damp twice (i.e., use the average damp of the average damp of y ⟼ x/y3) the fixed-point search does converge. Do some experiments to determine how many average damps are required to compute nth roots as a fixed-point search based upon repeated average damping of y ⟼ x/yn-1. Use this to implement a simple procedure for computing nth roots using fixed-point, average-damp, and the repeated procedure of exercise 1.43. Assume that any arithmetic operations you need are available as primitives.

**Answer:** 
After experiment, it's found that, in order to calculate the nth roots, the `average-damp` repeat count pattern is as below:

    1st -> 1
    2nd -> 1
    3rd -> 1
    4th -> 2
    5th -> 2
    6th -> 2
    7th -> 2
    8th -> 3
    9th -> 3
    10th -> 3
    11th -> 3
    12th -> 3
    13th -> 3
    14th -> 3
    15th -> 3
    16th -> 4

Hence, the `nth-root` procedure is written as:

```scheme
(define (compose f g)
    (lambda (x) (f (g x))))

(define (repeated f n)
    (define (loop k result)
        (if (= k 1)
            result
            (loop (- k 1) (compose f result))))
    (lambda (x) ((loop n f) x)))

(define tolerance 0.00001)

(define (fixed-point f first-guess)
  (define (close-enough? v1 v2)
    (< (abs (- v1 v2)) tolerance))
  (define (try guess)
    (let ((next (f guess)))
          (if (close-enough? guess next)
          next
          (try next))))
  (try first-guess))

(define (average-damp f)
  (lambda (x) (average x (f x))))

(define (average x y)
    (/ (+ x y) 2.0))

(define (even? n)
  (= (remainder n 2) 0))

(define (square n)
    (* n n))

(define (fast-expt b n)
    (define (fast-expt-iter b n ttl)
        (cond ((= n 0) ttl)
              ((even? n) (fast-expt-iter (square b) (/ n 2) ttl))
              (else (fast-expt-iter b (- n 1) (* ttl b)))))
    (fast-expt-iter b n 1))

(define (nth-root x n)
  (define (max-pow-2 x)
    (define (iter k result)
        (if (> result x)
           (- k 1)
           (iter (+ k 1) (* result 2))))
    (if (= x 1)
        1
        (iter 0 1)))
  (fixed-point ((repeated average-damp (max-pow-2 x)) (lambda (y) (/ x (fast-expt y (- n 1)))))
               1.0))

(nth-root 1024 10)
```
