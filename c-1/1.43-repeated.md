If f is a numerical function and n is a positive integer, then we can form the nth repeated application of f, which is defined to be the function whose value at x is f(f(...(f(x))...)). For example, if f is the function x ⟼ x + 1, then the nth repeated application of f is the function x ⟼ x + n. If f is the operation of squaring a number, then the nth repeated application of f is the function that raises its argument to the 2^n th power. Write a procedure that takes as inputs a procedure that computes f and a positive integer n and returns the procedure that computes the nth repeated application of f. Your procedure should be able to be used as follows:

```scheme
((repeated square 2) 5)
; 625
```

Hint: You may find it convenient to use compose from exercise 1.42.

```scheme
(define (square x) (* x x))

; Iterative approach

(define (repeated f n)
    (define (loop k x result)
        (if (= k 1)
            result
            (loop (- k 1) x (f result))))
    (lambda (x) (loop n x (f x))))


; Using compose
(define (compose f g)
    (lambda (x) (f (g x))))

(define (repeated f n)
    (define (loop k result)
        (if (= k 1)
            result
            (loop (- k 1) (compose f result))))
    (lambda (x) ((loop n f) x)))
```
