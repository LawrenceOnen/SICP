Suppose we define the procedure

```scheme
(define (f g)
  (g 2))

Then we have

(f square)
4

(f (lambda (z) (* z (+ z 1))))
6
```

What happens if we (perversely) ask the interpreter to evaluate the combination (f f)? Explain.

Error mesage shows as: ;The object 2 is not applicable.
Based on substitution model, `(f f)` leads to `(f 2)`.  But `2` cannot be evaludated as operator.
