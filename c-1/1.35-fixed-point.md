Show that the golden ratio φ (section 1.2.2) is a fixed point of the transformation x ⟼ 1 + 1/x, and use this fact to compute φ by means of the fixed-point procedure.

```scheme
; A number x is called a fixed point of a function f if x satisfies the equation f(x) = x.

(define tolerance 0.00001)
(define (fixed-point f first-guess)
  (define (close-enough? v1 v2)
    (< (abs (- v1 v2)) tolerance))
  (define (try guess)
    (let ((next (f guess)))
     (if (close-enough? guess next)
          next
          (try next))))
  (try first-guess))

(fixed-point (lambda (x) (+ 1 (/ 1.0 x))) .5) ; 1.618035190615836
```
