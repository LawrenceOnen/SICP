Modify your reverse procedure of exercise 2.18 to produce a deep-reverse procedure that takes a list as argument and returns as its value the list with its elements reversed and with all sublists deep-reversed as well. For example,

```scheme
(define x (list (list 1 2) (list 3 4)))

x
((1 2) (3 4))

(reverse x)
((3 4) (1 2))

(deep-reverse x)
((4 3) (2 1))
```

**Answer**

```scheme
(define (reverse l)
    (define (iter result remained)
        (if (null? remained)
            result
            (iter (cons (car remained) result) (cdr remained))))
    (iter '() l))

(define (deep-reverse l)
    (define (iter result remained)
        (if (null? remained)
            result
            (let ((y (car remained)))
                (iter (cons (if (pair? y) (deep-reverse y) y) result) (cdr remained)))))
    (iter '() l))
```
