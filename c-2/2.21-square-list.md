The procedure square-list takes a list of numbers as argument and returns a list of the squares of those numbers.

```scheme
(square-list (list 1 2 3 4))
(1 4 9 16)
```

Here are two different definitions of square-list. Complete both of them by filling in the missing expressions:

```scheme
(define (square-list items)
  (if (null? items)
      nil
      (cons <??> <??>)))

(define (square-list items)
  (map <??> <??>))
```

**Answer**

```scheme
(define (square x)
    (* x x))

(define (square-list items)
    (if (null? items)
        '()
        (cons (square (car items)) (square-list (cdr items)))))

(define (map proc items)
  (if (null? items)
      '()
      (cons (proc (car items))
            (map proc (cdr items)))))

(define (square-list items)
    (map square items))

(square-list (list 1 2 3 4))
```
