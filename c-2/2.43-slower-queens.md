Louis Reasoner is having a terrible time doing exercise 2.42. His `queens` procedure seems to work, but it runs extremely slowly. (Louis never does manage to wait long enough for it to solve even the 6× 6 case.) When Louis asks Eva Lu Ator for help, she points out that he has interchanged the order of the nested mappings in the `flatmap`, writing it as

```scheme
(flatmap
 (lambda (new-row)
   (map (lambda (rest-of-queens)
          (adjoin-position new-row k rest-of-queens))
        (queen-cols (- k 1))))
 (enumerate-interval 1 board-size))
```

Explain why this interchange makes the program run slowly. Estimate how long it will take Louis's program to solve the eight-queens puzzle, assuming that the program in exercise 2.42 solves the puzzle in time T.

**Answer**

Originally, `(queens 8)` only call `(queens 7)` once.  After moving the `queen-cols` inside the `flatmap`, it's called 8 times.  Substantially, it's changed from linear recursion to tree recursion.

>In general, the number of steps required by a tree-recursive process will be proportional to the number of nodes in the tree, while the space required will be proportional to the maximum depth of the tree.

Hence the modified version is approximately T⁸ when calculating (queens 8).
