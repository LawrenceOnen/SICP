Define a procedure reverse that takes a list as argument and returns a list of the same elements in reverse order:

```scheme
(define (reverse l)
    (define (iter result remained)
        (if (null? remained)
            result
            (iter (cons (car remained) result) (cdr remained))))
    (iter '() l))

(reverse (list 1 4 9 16 25))
```
