Use `segments->painter` to define the following primitive painters:

a.  The painter that draws the outline of the designated frame.

b.  The painter that draws an “X” by connecting opposite corners of the frame.

c.  The painter that draws a diamond shape by connecting the midpoints of the sides of the frame.

d.  The `wave` painter.
