Implement a representation for rectangles in a plane. (Hint: You may want to make use of exercise 2.2.) In terms of your constructors and selectors, create procedures that compute the perimeter and the area of a given rectangle. Now implement a different representation for rectangles. Can you design your system with suitable abstraction barriers, so that the same perimeter and area procedures will work using either representation?

```scheme
(define (perimeter l w)
    (* 2 (+ l w)))

(define (area l w)
    (* l w))


; Representation 1: Opposite 2 points
; A --------------
; |              |
; ---------------B

(define (make-point x y)
    (cons x y))

(define (x-point p)
    (car p))

(define (y-point p)
    (cdr p))

(define (abs x)
    (if (> x 0) x (- x)))

(define (make-rect-by-2points top-left-p bottom-right-p)
    (cons top-left-p bottom-right-p))

(define (rect-length-by-2points rect)
    (abs (- (x-point (cdr rect)) (x-point (car rect)))))

(define (rect-width-by-2points rect)
    (abs (- (y-point (cdr rect)) (y-point (car rect)))))

; Representation 2: 1 point and length & width
; A------ l ------
; |              |
; w              |
; |              |
; ----------------

(define (make-rect-by-1point-len-wid p l w)
    (cons p (cons l w)))

(define (rect-length-by-1point-len-wid rect)
    (cdr (cdr rect)))

(define (rect-width-by-1point-len-wid rect)
    (cdr (car rect)))
```
