Make changes to the square limit of `wave` shown in figure 2.9 by working at each of the levels described above. In particular:

a.  Add some segments to the primitive `wave` painter of exercise  2.49 (to add a smile, for example).

b.  Change the pattern constructed by `corner-split` (for example, by using only one copy of the `up-split` and `right-split` images instead of two).

c.  Modify the version of `square-limit` that uses `square-of-four` so as to assemble the corners in a different pattern. (For example, you might make the big Mr. Rogers look outward from each corner of the square.)
