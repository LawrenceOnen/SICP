Define the transformation `flip-horiz`, which flips painters horizontally, and transformations that rotate painters counterclockwise by 180 degrees and 270 degrees.

```scheme
; In Drracket, transform-painter is a bit different from scheme
(define (flip-horizontal painter)
    ((transform-painter
        (make-vect 1 0)
        (make-vect 0 0)
        (make-vect 1 1)) painter))

(paint (flip-horizontal einstein))

(define (rotate-180 painter)
    ((transform-painter
        (make-vect 1 1)
        (make-vect 0 1)
        (make-vect 1 0)
        ) painter))

(paint (rotate-180 einstein))

(define (rotate-270 painter)
    ((transform-painter
        (make-vect 0 1)
        (make-vect 0 0)
        (make-vect 1 1)
        ) painter))

(paint (rotate-270 einstein))
```
