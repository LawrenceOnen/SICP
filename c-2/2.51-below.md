Define the `below` operation for painters. `below` takes two painters as arguments. The resulting painter, given a frame, draws with the first painter in the bottom of the frame and with the second painter in the top. Define below in two different ways â€“ first by writing a procedure that is analogous to the `beside` procedure given above, and again in terms of `beside` and suitable rotation operations (from exercise 2.50).

```scheme
; Version 1
(define (below painter1 painter2)
    (let ((vert-mid (make-vect 0.0 0.5)))
        (let ((paint-top
                ((transform-painter vert-mid (make-vect 1 0.5) (make-vect 0 1)) painter2))
              (paint-bottom
                ((transform-painter (make-vect 0.0 0.0) (make-vect 1.0 0.0) vert-mid) painter1)))
            (lambda(frame)
               (paint-top frame)
                (paint-bottom frame)))))

(paint (below einstein einstein))

(define (beside painter1 painter2)
  (let ((split-point (make-vect 0.5 0.0)))
    (let ((paint-left
           ((transform-painter (make-vect 0.0 0.0)
                              split-point
                              (make-vect 0.0 1.0)) painter1))
          (paint-right
           ((transform-painter split-point
                              (make-vect 1.0 0.0)
                              (make-vect 0.5 1.0)) painter1)))
      (lambda (frame)
        (paint-left frame)
        (paint-right frame)))))

(paint (beside einstein einstein))

; Version 2
(define (below painter1 painter2)
    (rotate-270 (beside (rotate-180 (rotate-270 painter1)) (rotate-180 (rotate-270 painter2)))))
```
