Abstract your answer to exercise 2.30 to produce a procedure `tree-map` with the property that square-tree could be defined as

```scheme
(define (square-tree tree) (tree-map square tree))
```

**Answer**

```scheme
(define (tree-map proc t)
    (cond ((null? t) '())
          ((pair? t) (cons (tree-map proc (car t)) (tree-map proc (cdr t))))
          (else (proc t))))
```
