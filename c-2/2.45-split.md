`Right-split` and `up-split` can be expressed as instances of a general splitting operation. Define a procedure `split` with the property that evaluating

```scheme
(define right-split (split beside below))
(define up-split (split below beside))
```

produces procedures `right-split` and `up-split` with the same behaviors as the ones already defined.

```scheme
(require (planet "sicp.ss" ("soegaard" "sicp.plt" 2 1))) ; Drracket
(paint einstein) ; Drracket

; Original
(define (right-split painter n)
  (if (= n 0)
      painter
      (let ((smaller (right-split painter (- n 1))))
        (beside painter (below smaller smaller)))))

(define (up-split painter n)
    (if (= n 0)
        painter
        (let ((smaller (up-split painter (- n 1))))
            (below painter (beside smaller smaller)))))

(define (split op1 op2)
    (lambda (painter n)
        (if (= n 0)
            painter
            (let ((smaller ((split op1 op2) painter (- n 1))))
                (op1 painter (op2 smaller smaller))))))
```
