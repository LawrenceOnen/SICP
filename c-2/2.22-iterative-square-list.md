Louis Reasoner tries to rewrite the first square-list procedure of exercise 2.21 so that it evolves an iterative process:

```scheme
(define (square-list items)
  (define (iter things answer)
    (if (null? things)
        answer
        (iter (cdr things) 
              (cons (square (car things))
                    answer))))
  (iter items '()))
```

Unfortunately, defining square-list this way produces the answer list in the reverse order of the one desired. Why?

**Answer**

The iterative process constructs the pair with the the first squared item in the list and remaining item.  Because it's taking the value sequencially, the item to be processed last is appended to the head of the list at the end.  So the final result is in reverse order.


Louis then tries to fix his bug by interchanging the arguments to cons:

```scheme
(define (square-list items)
  (define (iter things answer)
    (if (null? things)
        answer
        (iter (cdr things)
              (cons answer
                    (square (car things))))))
  (iter items '()))
```

This doesn't work either. Explain.

**Answer**

```scheme
     (square-list (list 1 2 3))
; -> (((() . 1) . 4) . 9)
```

You can easily see the result by testing it.
Because the first item now becomes the empty list, and it ends up with pair composing another pair.
